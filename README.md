Blueprinting objects with Ruby Classes [ruby, oop]

This is a pair or group exercise. Students will compare Javsascript Constructors to Ruby Classes. Students are expected to have been introduced to the topic of **Classes** in Ruby and will now use their prior Javascript knowledge to understand Ruby. Further reading on [https://ga-chicago.gitbooks.io/wdi-ravenclaw/content/04_ruby101/d02_classes_in_ruby.html](classes may be found here). An [http://ga-chicago.github.io/ruby-class/](interactive diagram is available), too.

## Exercise: Javascript to Ruby

* Inspect the `song.json` file in this repository. Identify the data that has been modelled.
* Read the `Song.js` file in this repository. Describe the function of it and how to _instantiate_ a new **thing**.
* Read the `song.rb` fine in this repository. Compare the `Song.js` to the `song.rb`. 
* What differences do you notice?

## Practice: Game Object

During your **first project**, you created a game. You will now create Ruby classes (and test them using `pry` or `irb`)! You should aim to create a **Player** and a **Score**. Each class should contain at least a _constructor method_ (`initialize`).
